Are you also tired of opening and finding your password in your notes app whenever you tried to log into some website a long time
OR fed up of changing your work gmail password every 2 weeks because your organisation sucks
So i created a CLI Tools in Go where you can store your passwords and get it copied to your clipboard with one simple command

myvault get gmail

yes thats it and it will copy your password to clipboard so you can goto the site and paste it directly
To add a Password use the following commmand

myvault set twitter ThisIsMyTwitterPassword

To get all passwords use the following command

myvault getall

That's it folks !!
